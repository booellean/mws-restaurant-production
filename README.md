# Restaurant Review Stage 2
## A Project by **Elle Pope** a.k.a **booellean**
### Notes About the Code
* Device used to run the server greatly affects the performance rating in Lighthouse reviews. Runs best on a desktop.

* There is currently no backup code for browsers that don't support indexedDB. This will be implemented in the future.

* The code is dependent on a refactored database. Please use booellean's [repository][repo-link] to download the database and run with [sails.js][sails-link]

* The production files are located in `/src/prod` while the development files are located in `/src/public/`. Please use production files when serving the website

* The gulpfile.js is NOT my own. This was going to be used as a reference, however, my node dependencies are having issues installing and thus was not used in production of the code. The original owner of the gulfile is [seetd][github-seetd] for the project [mws-restaurant-stage-1][mws-repo].
